# Dark Factory

Dark Factory is a self-contained module for running persistent, autonomous AI
agent teams on a remote headless machine using tmux. Each agent runs its own
AI CLI instance inside an isolated tmux pane or window, coordinated by a TDM
(Technical Delivery Manager) agent that orchestrates work through the SAFe
workflow. The entire factory is observable and controllable from Cursor IDE via
SSH.

**Supported runtimes:**
- **Claude Code** -- Anthropic's CLI agent (pane-based layouts)
- **Codex CLI** -- OpenAI's CLI agent with codex-yolo auto-approval (window-based layouts)

|------|----------------|---------|
| tmux | 3.0+ | Session and pane management |
| Claude Code | 2.1+ | AI agent runtime |
| GitHub CLI (`gh`) | 2.0+ | PR creation and merge queue |
| git | 2.30+ | Worktree support |

### Codex CLI Factory (additional)

| Tool | Minimum Version | Purpose |
|------|----------------|---------|

## Quick Start

### Claude Code Factory

```bash
# 1. One-time setup (validates prerequisites and merge queue)
./dark-factory/scripts/factory-setup.sh

# 2. Launch a feature-sized agent team for a ticket
./dark-factory/scripts/factory-start.sh feature {{TICKET_PREFIX}}-123

# 3. Check on running sessions
./dark-factory/scripts/factory-status.sh
```

### Codex CLI Factory

```bash
# 1. Run the same one-time setup (shared infrastructure)
./dark-factory/scripts/factory-setup.sh

# 2. Copy and customize the Codex factory template
cp dark-factory/templates/codex-factory.sh /tmp/my-codex-factory.sh
# Edit: replace {{PLACEHOLDER}} tokens with your project values

# 3. Launch the Codex factory
bash /tmp/my-codex-factory.sh

# 4. Monitor via audit log (built into the Control window)
tail -f ~/.codex-yolo/audit.log
```

## Operator's Quick Reference

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# Morning: Start a team for today's ticket
./dark-factory/scripts/factory-start.sh feature {{TICKET_PREFIX}}-42

# Throughout the day: Check on your agents
./dark-factory/scripts/factory-status.sh

# Auto-refreshing dashboard (updates every 5 seconds)
watch -n 5 ./dark-factory/scripts/factory-status.sh

# Tail all agent logs live
tail -f ~/.dark-factory/logs/factory-{{TICKET_PREFIX}}-42/*.log

# Jump into a specific agent's pane to observe
./dark-factory/scripts/factory-attach.sh factory-{{TICKET_PREFIX}}-42 2

# End of day: Graceful shutdown
./dark-factory/scripts/factory-stop.sh factory-{{TICKET_PREFIX}}-42
```

### Status Dashboard Output

The status dashboard shows health for every agent in every session:

```
========================================
  Dark Factory Status Dashboard
========================================

Session: factory-{{TICKET_PREFIX}}-42
  Created: 2026-03-06 09:15:00
  Panes:
    [1] TDM (lead)           active        ← Claude running, recent output
    [2] BE Developer         active
    [3] FE Developer         idle (342s)   ← Claude running, no activity 5+ min
    [4] QAS                  dead          ← Claude process exited
    [5] RTE                  active

Aggregate Stats
  Sessions:  1
  Agents:    5 (3 active, 1 idle, 1 dead)
  Processes: 4 claude process(es), ~1200MB RSS
```

**Color codes**: green = active, yellow = idle, red = dead.

**If a pane shows "dead"**: Attach and check for errors:
```bash
./dark-factory/scripts/factory-attach.sh factory-{{TICKET_PREFIX}}-42 4
# In the pane, restart: claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

### Observing from Cursor IDE (Remote SSH)

1. Connect Cursor to your server via Remote-SSH
2. Open a terminal: `Ctrl+\``
3. Attach read-only: `tmux attach -t factory-{{TICKET_PREFIX}}-42 -r`
4. Navigate panes: `Alt+Arrow` or `Prefix+q` (show numbers)
5. Zoom one pane: `Prefix+z` (toggle)
6. See file changes: Open worktree in Cursor's file explorer

See [Cursor SSH Guide](docs/CURSOR-SSH-GUIDE.md) for full setup.

## Relationship to Main Harness

This module is additive. It does not modify any files in `.claude/`, `.codex/`,
`.gemini/`, or `docs/`. Your existing harness configuration is untouched. Dark
Factory scripts reference the same `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and
`patterns_library/` that your interactive workflow uses -- agents in the factory
follow the same SAFe conventions as agents run locally. Codex CLI agents
additionally read `.codex/agents/*.toml` for role-specific configuration.
