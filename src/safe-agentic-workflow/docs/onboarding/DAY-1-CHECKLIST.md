# Day 1 Checklist: SAFe Multi-Agent Development

**Purpose**: Your first day with the SAFe multi-agent methodology - complete this checklist to validate your setup.

**Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours

**Prerequisites**:

- Access to Claude Code or Augment Code
- Linear/Jira account with API access
- GitHub account with repository access
- Basic understanding of SAFe principles (optional but helpful)

---

## Phase 1: Repository Setup (30 minutes)

### Step 1.1: Clone Repository

```bash
# Clone the template repository
git clone {{GITHUB_REPO_URL}}
cd {{PROJECT_NAME}}

# Explore the structure
ls -la
cat README.md
```

**Validation**:

- [ ] Repository cloned successfully
- [ ] Can see `.claude/agents/` directory
- [ ] Can see `AGENTS.md` file

---

### Step 1.2: Load Repository Context (Optional but Recommended)

**Option A: Use GitIngest** (Recommended)

1. Visit: https://gitingest.com/{{GITHUB_ORG}}/{{GITHUB_REPO}}
2. Copy the generated context
3. Paste into your AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
4. Ask: "Explain the SAFe multi-agent methodology in 3 paragraphs"

**Option B: Read Documentation**

1. Read: `README.md` (5 min)
2. Read: `AGENTS.md` (10 min)

**Validation**:

- [ ] Understand the 11 agent roles
- [ ] Understand the SAFe workflow (Epic → Feature → Story)
- [ ] Understand the "Search First, Reuse Always" philosophy

---

## Phase 2: Agent Provider Setup (30 minutes)

### Step 2.1: Choose Your Agent Provider

**Option A: Claude Code** (Recommended)

- Best for: Teams using Claude API
- Installation: https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/claude-code
- Agent files location: `.claude/agents/`

**Option B: Augment Code**

- Best for: Teams using Augment
- Installation: https://www.augmentcode.com/
- Agent files location: `agent_providers/augment/`

**Decision**:

- [ ] I'm using: [Claude Code / Augment Code / Other]

---

### Step 2.2: Install Agent Prompts

**For Claude Code**:

```bash
# Option 1: Copy to user directory (single user)
cp -r .claude/agents/* ~/.claude/agents/

# Option 2: Use in-project (team sharing)
# Agents are already in .claude/agents/ - no action needed
# Claude Code will auto-detect them
```

**For Augment Code**:

```bash
# Copy Augment-specific configurations
cp -r agent_providers/augment/* ~/.augment/
```

**Validation**:

- [ ] Agent files copied to correct location
- [ ] Can see 11 agent files (bsa.md, system-architect.md, etc.)
- [ ] Agent provider recognizes the agents

---

### Step 2.3: Verify Agent Installation

**Test Agent Invocation**:

1. Open your agent provider (Claude Code or Augment)
2. Try to invoke the BSA agent
3. Ask: "What is your role as the BSA agent?"

**Expected Response**: The agent should respond with its role description from the agent prompt file.

**Validation**:

- [ ] Agent responds with correct role description
- [ ] Agent mentions "Business Systems Analyst"
- [ ] Agent mentions "pattern discovery" and "acceptance criteria"

---

## Phase 3: Tool Integration (30 minutes)

## Phase 6: Agent Teams Setup (Optional — 20 minutes)

> **Skip this phase** if your team does not use Claude Code Agent Teams.
> Come back when you're ready to run parallel multi-agent sessions.

### Step 6.1: Enable Agent Teams

```bash
# Option A: Environment variable (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1

# Option B: Settings file (~/.claude/settings.json)
# Add: { "experiments": { "agentTeams": true } }
```

### Step 6.2: Verify Agent Teams Tools

```bash
cd {{PROJECT_NAME}}
claude
```

Inside the session, ask:

```
Can you confirm that Agent Teams tools are available?
List the team-related tools you have access to.
```

**Expected**: You should see `TeamCreate`, `SendMessage`, `TaskCreate`,
`TaskUpdate`, `TaskList`, and `TeamDelete`.

### Step 6.3: Spawn a Test Team

```
Create a small test team with 2 teammates:
1. A BE Developer to review the project structure
2. A QAS to validate the agent setup

Each teammate should report what they find and then shut down.
```

**Validation**:

- [ ] Agent Teams experimental flag is enabled
- [ ] Team tools are visible in Claude Code
- [ ] Test team spawned successfully
- [ ] Teammates communicated via the shared TaskList
- [ ] Team shut down cleanly

## Phase 7: Dark Factory Setup (Optional — 30 minutes)

> **Skip this phase** if your team does not have a remote dev server.
> Dark Factory is for running persistent, autonomous agent teams via tmux
> on an always-on machine.

### Step 7.1: Verify Remote Prerequisites

SSH into your remote server and confirm:

```bash
ssh {{REMOTE_HOST}}

# Check prerequisites
tmux -V          # tmux 3.0+
claude --version # Claude Code 2.1.0+
git --version    # git 2.30+
gh --version     # GitHub CLI 2.0+
```

### Step 7.2: Run Factory Setup

```bash
cd /path/to/{{PROJECT_NAME}}
./dark-factory/scripts/factory-setup.sh
```

The setup script will:
- Check all prerequisites
- Create `~/.dark-factory/` configuration directory
- Copy `env.template` for you to customize
- Verify merge queue enforcement on your repository

### Step 7.3: Configure Environment

```bash
nano ~/.dark-factory/env
```

Fill in your project values:

```bash
FACTORY_PROJECT_DIR="/path/to/{{PROJECT_NAME}}"
FACTORY_MAIN_BRANCH="{{MAIN_BRANCH}}"
FACTORY_TICKET_PREFIX="{{TICKET_PREFIX}}"
FACTORY_USE_WORKTREES=true
FACTORY_AUTO_PERMISSIONS=true
CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1
```

### Step 7.4: Test a Factory Session

```bash
# Start a small story team
./dark-factory/scripts/factory-start.sh story {{TICKET_PREFIX}}-TEST

# Check status
./dark-factory/scripts/factory-status.sh

# Stop the test session
./dark-factory/scripts/factory-stop.sh
```

**Validation**:

- [ ] Remote server meets all prerequisites
- [ ] `factory-setup.sh` completed without errors
- [ ] `~/.dark-factory/env` configured with your values
- [ ] Test factory session started and showed 3 panes (TDM + BE + QAS)
