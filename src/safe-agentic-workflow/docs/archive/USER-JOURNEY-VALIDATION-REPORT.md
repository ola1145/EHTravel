## Part 2: Quick Start Paths Validation

### For Practitioners Path

| Step          | Link                                                    | Status    | Notes                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |

**Assessment**: ✅ **PASS** - All links valid

**Gap Identified**: Step 3 "Implement" links to Section 9, but Section 9 assumes familiarity with Claude Code agent system. New users may not know:

- How to install Claude Code
- Where to put agent files
- How to invoke agents
- What `.claude/agents/*.md` files do

### For Researchers Path

| Step                        | Link                                                | Status    | Notes                             |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------- |

**Assessment**: ✅ **PASS** - All links valid, excellent research documentation

### For Leaders Path

| Step               | Link                                                              | Status    | Notes                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------- |

**Assessment**: ✅ **MOSTLY PASS** - All files exist, anchor link not validated but likely exists

---

## Part 4: Agent Setup Instructions Review

### Current State


**What's Good**:

- ✅ Clear prerequisites (technical, team, organizational)
- ✅ Step-by-step installation instructions
- ✅ Environment configuration examples
- ✅ Phased agent rollout strategy

**What's Missing**:

- ❌ No explanation of what `.claude/agents/*.md` files are
- ❌ No explanation of Claude Code vs. Augment Code
- ❌ No link to Claude Code documentation
- ❌ No troubleshooting section for agent setup
- ❌ No validation that agents are installed correctly
- ❌ No "Hello World" example for first agent invocation

### Agent Files Discovery

**Agent Prompts Located**:

- `.claude/agents/` - 11 agent files (bsa.md, system-architect.md, etc.)
- `agent_providers/claude_code/prompts/` - Duplicate agent files
- `agent_providers/augment/` - Augment-specific configurations

**Confusion Risk**: New users may not understand:

1. Which directory to use (`.claude/agents/` vs. `agent_providers/`)
2. How to install agents in Claude Code
3. How to invoke agents once installed
4. What the frontmatter (name, description, tools, model) means

---

## Part 5: Identified Gaps

### Critical Gaps

1. **No "Quick Start for Agents" Section in README**
   - **Impact**: HIGH
   - **User Pain**: New users don't know where to start with agent setup
   - **Recommendation**: Add section after "Quick Start" with 3-step agent setup

2. **Agent Installation Instructions Buried**
   - **Impact**: MEDIUM
   - **User Pain**: Users must read 100+ lines of Section 9 to find setup
   - **Recommendation**: Create `docs/onboarding/AGENT-SETUP-GUIDE.md`

3. **No "Day 1" Checklist**
   - **Impact**: MEDIUM
   - **User Pain**: Users don't know what to do after cloning repo
   - **Recommendation**: Create `docs/onboarding/DAY-1-CHECKLIST.md`

### Minor Gaps

4. **No Agent Invocation Examples**
   - **Impact**: LOW
   - **User Pain**: Users don't know how to actually use agents
   - **Recommendation**: Add examples to AGENTS.md

5. **No Troubleshooting Guide**
   - **Impact**: LOW
   - **User Pain**: Users get stuck and have no help
   - **Recommendation**: Create `docs/onboarding/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

6. **Template Placeholder Documentation Scattered**
   - **Impact**: LOW
   - **User Pain**: Users don't know all placeholders to replace
   - **Recommendation**: Create `docs/onboarding/TEMPLATE-CUSTOMIZATION.md`

## Part 6: User Journey Simulation

### Scenario: New Developer Adopting Methodology

**Step 1**: User lands on README

- ✅ Sees GitIngest link immediately
- ✅ Understands this is a SAFe multi-agent methodology
- ✅ Sees production validation badges

**Step 2**: User clicks "For Practitioners" → "Implement"

- ✅ Reaches Section 9 Implementation Guide
- ⚠️ Sees installation steps but confused about Claude Code
- ❌ Doesn't know if they need Claude Code or Augment Code
- ❌ Doesn't know how to install agents

**Step 3**: User tries to follow installation

- ⚠️ Clones repository successfully
- ❌ Confused by `.env.template` (doesn't exist in repo)
- ❌ Confused by `./scripts/install-prompts.sh` (doesn't exist)
- ❌ Stuck - no clear next steps

**Step 4**: User explores repository

- ✅ Finds `.claude/agents/` directory
- ⚠️ Sees 11 agent files but doesn't know what to do with them
- ❌ Doesn't know how to invoke agents
- ❌ Gives up or asks for help

**Conclusion**: User journey breaks down at agent installation step.
