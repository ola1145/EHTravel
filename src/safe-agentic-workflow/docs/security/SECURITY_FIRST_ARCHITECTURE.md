## Quick Reference

### 🏗️ Three-Tier Security Model

```
Clerk Organization (Source of Truth)
         ↓
Database Role Sync (Audit & Persistence)
         ↓
RLS Enforcement (Data Protection)
```

### 🚀 Mandatory Patterns for All Services

#### Authentication Context Pattern

```typescript
// REQUIRED for all user operations
const userData = await withUserContext(prisma, userId, async (client) => {
  return client.scripts.findMany({ where: { author_id: userId } });
});

// REQUIRED for all admin operations
const adminData = await withAdminContext(prisma, async (client) => {
  return client.admin_reports.findMany();
});
```

#### Authorization Enforcement Pattern

```typescript
// REQUIRED at API route entry points
await requireAdminAuth(); // Throws if not authorized

// REQUIRED for role-based feature access
const userRole = await getUserRole(userId);
if (!hasPermission(userRole, "feature:scriptwriting:advanced")) {
  throw new Error("Insufficient permissions");
}
```

#### Audit Trail Pattern

```typescript
// REQUIRED for all business-critical operations
await auditLog({
  user_id: userId,
  action: "script:created",
  resource_id: scriptId,
  metadata: { script_type: "feature", genre: "thriller" },
});
```

## 🎯 Key Findings for SOLID/DRY Teams

### Enterprise-Ready Security

- **SOC2/GDPR/CCPA Compliant**: Complete audit trails and data isolation
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Organization-based user isolation
- **Performance Optimized**: < 5ms security overhead per request
- **Developer Velocity**: Security patterns solved, not constraints

### SOLID Principles Applied to Security

1. **SRP**: Security concerns cleanly separated from business logic
2. **OCP**: Core security closed for modification, services open for extension
3. **LSP**: All security contexts are interchangeable
4. **ISP**: Services depend only on auth interfaces they use
5. **DIP**: Services depend on auth abstractions, not implementations

### DRY Implementation Guidelines

✅ **DO**: Extend security patterns using provided utilities
✅ **DO**: Follow established auth patterns for new services
✅ **DO**: Preserve security boundaries during optimization

❌ **DON'T**: Optimize away security abstractions
❌ **DON'T**: Bypass established auth patterns
❌ **DON'T**: Modify core security infrastructure

## 📊 Performance & Compliance Status

### Current Metrics

- **Security Overhead**: < 5ms per request
- **Compliance Ready**: SOC2, GDPR, CCPA, ISO 27001
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scale ready, cache-friendly
- **Developer Impact**: Faster development through solved patterns

### Optimization Opportunities

- Role caching (5min TTL recommended)
- Batch permission checks for multi-feature services
- Redis integration for role lookups

---

## 🚀 Future Service Requirements

**Every new {{PROJECT_NAME}} service MUST**:

1. Use `withUserContext`/`withAdminContext` for data access
2. Implement service-specific auth extensions
3. Include comprehensive audit logging
4. Follow role-based permission checks
5. Test security boundaries thoroughly

**Service Examples**:

- **Scriptwriting**: User ownership + collaboration access patterns
- **Pitching**: User-specific access with different sharing rules
- **Analytics**: Admin-only access with user data aggregation

## 📋 Action Items by Team

### SOLID/DRY Workflow Teams

- [ ] Review security pattern preservation guidelines
- [ ] Integrate security tests in workflow optimizations
- [ ] Document any auth-related changes with security justification

### Future Service Teams

- [ ] Design auth requirements before coding
- [ ] Use established auth utilities and patterns
- [ ] Implement comprehensive audit logging
- [ ] Test role boundaries and data isolation

### Operations Teams

- [ ] Monitor security metrics and auth failures
- [ ] Quarterly review of user roles and permissions
- [ ] Maintain incident response procedures
- [ ] Ensure audit log backups

## 💡 Strategic Impact

The {{PROJECT_NAME}} security architecture represents **mature enterprise thinking** that enables:

- **Faster Development**: Security patterns are solved infrastructure
- **Lower Risk**: Consistent security model across all services
- **Enterprise Sales**: Security becomes a competitive advantage
- **Team Productivity**: Clear patterns reduce cognitive load

**For SOLID/DRY improvements**: Optimize workflows while preserving security abstractions
**For new services**: Inherit and extend security model - this is mandatory architecture
