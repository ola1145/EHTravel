# Repository Reorganization - Executive Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: PLAN READY - Awaiting Approval  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Impact**: HIGH (affects all documentation references)

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The repository root directory has become cluttered with **17 files** (14 .md files + 3 other), making it difficult for new users to:

- Identify essential files
- Navigate documentation
- Understand repository structure
- Find related documentation

**Current State**: Confusing and overwhelming for new users  
**Desired State**: Clean root with organized documentation subdirectories

---

## 📊 Proposed Changes

### Files to Keep in Root (9 files)

✅ Essential files that users expect at root level:

- `README.md` - Primary entry point
- `LICENSE` - MIT License
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Community guidelines
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contributor guide
- `CITATION.bib` - BibTeX citation
- `CITATION.cff` - Citation File Format
- `.env.template` - Environment configuration
- `AGENTS.md` - Agent quick reference (AI assistant convention)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code guidance (AI assistant convention)

**Rationale for keeping AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md in root**: These files follow standard conventions set by Anthropic and OpenAI for AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Augment, etc.). Moving them would break conventions and require updating numerous references.

### Files to Move (8 files)

**To `docs/database/`** (4 files):

- `DATA_DICTIONARY.md` - Schema template
- `RLS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - RLS patterns
- `RLS_POLICY_CATALOG.md` - RLS policy template
- `RLS_DATABASE_MIGRATION_SOP.md` - Migration SOP

**To `docs/security/`** (1 file):

- `SECURITY_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Security patterns

**To `docs/ci-cd/`** (1 file):

- `CI-CD-Pipeline-Guide.md` - CI/CD standards

**To `docs/archive/`** (1 file):

- `README-TEMPLATE.md` - Archived template

**To `scripts/`** (1 file):

- `apply-workflow.sh` - Workflow script

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan

### Automated Scripts Created

1. **`scripts/reorganize-docs.sh`** (289 lines)
   - Creates new directories
   - Moves files using `git mv` (preserves history)
   - Creates README.md index files for each directory
   - Calls reference update script
   - Provides summary and next steps

2. **`scripts/update-doc-references.sh`** (200 lines)
   - Updates all references in README.md
   - Updates all references in docs/onboarding/\*.md
   - Updates all references in agent prompts
   - Updates all references in whitepaper
   - Creates backups of all modified files
   - Provides summary of changes

### Manual Steps Required

1. **Review Plan**: Read `docs/REPOSITORY-REORGANIZATION-PLAN.md`
2. **Create Linear Ticket**: e.g., {{TICKET_PREFIX}}-XXX
3. **Run Script**: `./scripts/reorganize-docs.sh`
4. **Verify Changes**: Follow verification checklist
5. **Test Agents**: Ensure all agent prompts still work
6. **Commit**: Single commit with clear message

---

## 📋 Verification Checklist

After running the reorganization script:

### 1. File Structure

- [ ] Root directory has ≤ 7 files
- [ ] All moved files in correct subdirectories
- [ ] Each new directory has README.md index
- [ ] No orphaned files

### 2. Links and References

- [ ] README.md links work
- [ ] docs/onboarding/\*.md links work
- [ ] Agent prompt references work
- [ ] Whitepaper references work

### 3. Agent Functionality

- [ ] @bsa invocation works
- [ ] @system-architect invocation works
- [ ] @data-engineer invocation works
- [ ] @security-engineer invocation works
- [ ] All agents can find referenced docs

### 4. User Journey

- [ ] README Quick Start for Agents works
- [ ] docs/onboarding/AGENT-SETUP-GUIDE.md works
- [ ] docs/onboarding/DAY-1-CHECKLIST.md works
- [ ] All onboarding links functional

## 📈 Expected Benefits

### Before Reorganization

- **Root files**: 17
- **User confusion**: HIGH
- **Discoverability**: LOW
- **Maintainability**: LOW

### After Reorganization

- **Root files**: 9 (47% reduction)
- **User confusion**: LOW
- **Discoverability**: HIGH
- **Maintainability**: HIGH

### Specific Improvements

1. **Cleaner Root Directory**
   - Only essential files visible
   - Clear entry points for new users
   - Professional appearance

2. **Better Organization**
   - Related docs grouped together
   - Logical categorization
   - Easy to find specific topics

3. **Improved Navigation**
   - README.md index in each category
   - Clear documentation hierarchy
   - Breadcrumb-style navigation

4. **Preserved History**
   - Using `git mv` maintains file history
   - No loss of commit information
   - Easy to track changes over time

5. **No Broken Links**
   - Systematic reference updates
   - Automated verification
   - Backup files for safety

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Broken Links

**Impact**: HIGH  
**Probability**: MEDIUM  
**Mitigation**:

- Automated reference update script
- Comprehensive verification checklist
- Backup files created before changes

### Risk 2: Agent Prompts Break

**Impact**: HIGH  
**Probability**: LOW  
**Mitigation**:

- Test all agent invocations after reorganization
- Agent prompts updated systematically
- Rollback plan available

### Risk 3: User Confusion

**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Probability**: LOW  
**Mitigation**:

- Clear README.md navigation
- README.md index in each new directory
- Documentation of changes in commit message

### Risk 4: External Links Break

**Impact**: LOW  
**Probability**: LOW  
**Mitigation**:

- GitHub automatically redirects old file paths
- Update external documentation if needed

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Automated (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Review the plan
cat docs/REPOSITORY-REORGANIZATION-PLAN.md

# 2. Run the reorganization script
./scripts/reorganize-docs.sh

# 3. Review changes
git status
git diff

# 4. Test agents
# (In Claude Code or Augment)
@bsa What is your role?

# 5. Commit
git commit -m "docs: reorganize root directory documentation [{{TICKET_PREFIX}}-XXX]

Move documentation files from root to organized subdirectories:
- Database docs → docs/database/
- Security docs → docs/security/
- CI/CD docs → docs/ci-cd/
- Archived docs → docs/archive/
- Scripts → scripts/

Keep AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md in root (AI assistant convention).

Update all references in onboarding docs, agent prompts, and whitepaper.

Root directory reduced from 17 to 9 files (47% reduction).
All documentation organized by category with README.md indexes."
```

### Option 2: Manual

Follow the detailed steps in `docs/REPOSITORY-REORGANIZATION-PLAN.md`.
