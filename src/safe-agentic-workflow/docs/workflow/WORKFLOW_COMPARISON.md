## TDM Role Evolution

### v1.0: Coordinator

````text
TDM responsibilities (v1.0):
- Assign work to agents
- Resolve blockers
- Update Linear tickets
- Track progress

No involvement in:
❌ Pre-implementation verification
❌ PR review chain
❌ Feedback coordination
```text

### v1.1: Orchestrator + Gatekeeper

```text
TDM responsibilities (v1.1):
- Assign work to agents (same)
- Resolve blockers (same)
- Update Linear tickets (same)
- Track progress (same)

NEW involvement:
✅ Pre-implementation gate (verify CONTRIBUTING.md)
✅ PR review escalation chain
✅ Feedback coordination (route fixes to agents)
```text

**Impact**: TDM becomes central coordinator, not just tracker

> **Note (v1.3+)**: TDM is now "delivery manager" (reactive blocker resolution), not orchestrator.
> ARCHitect-in-CLI is the primary orchestrator. See `WORKFLOW_CHANGES_v1.3.md`.

---

## Feedback Loop Comparison

### v1.0: Manual Human Feedback

```text
Scott finds issue
  ↓
Scott manually notifies team
  ↓
Team manually coordinates fix
  ↓
Manual re-review by Scott
```text

**Problems**:

- High manual coordination overhead
- No structured feedback mechanism
- Scott involved in every iteration

### v1.1: Structured Agent Feedback

```text
System Architect finds issue
  ↓
TDM automatically notified
  ↓
TDM coordinates with dev agent
  ↓
Automated re-review by System Architect
  ↓
(Repeat until approved)
  ↓
ARCHitect-in-CLI finds issue
  ↓
(Same structured loop)
  ↓
Only escalate to Scott when ready
```text

**Benefits**:

- Automated escalation
- Structured feedback loop
- Scott only sees approved PRs

---

## Timeline Comparison

### v1.0 Typical PR Lifecycle

```text
1. Spec creation: 30-60 min
2. Implementation: 2-4 hours
3. Testing: 30-60 min
4. PR creation: 15 min
   ──────────────────────
   Subtotal: ~4-6 hours
5. Scott review: Variable (hours to days)
   ──────────────────────
   TOTAL: 4-6 hours + human wait time
```text

### v1.1 Typical PR Lifecycle

```text
1. Spec creation: 30-60 min
2. **Pre-gate verification: 5 min** (NEW)
3. Implementation: 2-4 hours
4. Testing: 30-60 min
5. PR creation: 15 min
6. **System Architect review: 5-15 min** (NEW)
7. **ARCHitect-in-CLI review: 10-20 min** (NEW)
   ──────────────────────
   Subtotal: ~4.5-6.5 hours + 20-40 min agents
8. Scott review: Variable (but faster - higher quality PRs)
   ──────────────────────
   TOTAL: ~5-7 hours + human wait time

Additional time: +20-40 minutes for agent reviews
Savings: Less time in Scott review (fewer iterations)
```text

**Net Impact**: Slightly longer upfront, but faster overall (fewer Scott iterations)

## Risk Assessment

### Risks in v1.0

| Risk                       | Impact | Mitigation                  |
| -------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| All review burden on Scott | High   | None (manual bottleneck)    |
| Issues caught late         | Medium | Only CI/CD automated checks |
| No feedback loop           | Medium | Manual coordination         |
| Work starts wrong          | Low    | Team discipline             |

### Risks in v1.1

| Risk                      | Impact       | Mitigation               |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Agent reviews ineffective | Medium       | Scott still final gate   |
| Longer PR cycle           | Low          | Track metrics, adjust    |
| Review bottleneck         | Low          | Automated agent reviews  |
| Work starts wrong         | **Very Low** | **Pre-gate enforcement** |

**Verdict**: v1.1 reduces risk overall (more gates, less human burden)

---

## Success Criteria

After testing v1.1 with Free Tools feature:

### Must Achieve (Required)

- [ ] Agent reviews add <1 hour total to PR cycle
- [ ] System Architect catches ≥1 real architectural issue
- [ ] ARCHitect-in-CLI provides useful feedback
- [ ] Scott's review is faster (fewer issues to catch)
- [ ] No regression in code quality

### Nice to Have (Desired)

- [ ] Agent reviews catch 80%+ of issues Scott would catch
- [ ] TDM feedback coordination is smooth
- [ ] Team feels more confident in PR quality
- [ ] Linear tracking more accurate (pre-gate enforcement)

### Rollback Triggers (Deal-breakers)

- [ ] Agent reviews add >2 hours to PR cycle
- [ ] Agent reviews miss critical security issues
- [ ] More friction than v1.0 (team frustration)
- [ ] Scott's review load increases

---

## Recommendation

**Proceed with v1.1** for the following reasons:

1. **Pre-implementation gate** prevents costly mistakes early
2. **Agent reviews** leverage Opus reasoning (strong architectural validation)
3. **Scott's time protected** - only reviews high-quality PRs
4. **Reversible** - can rollback to v1.0 with documented baseline
5. **Real-world test** - Free Tools feature will validate effectiveness

**Next Steps**:

1. Update workflow files (AGENT_WORKFLOW_SOP.md, agent configs)
2. Execute Free Tools feature using v1.1
3. Collect metrics and feedback
4. Iterate to v1.2 or rollback to v1.0 based on results
