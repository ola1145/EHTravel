This directory contains all database-related documentation including schema, security, and migration procedures.

## 📚 Documentation Files

### [DATA_DICTIONARY.md](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md)

**Single source of truth** for database schema:

- Table definitions and relationships
- Column specifications and constraints
- Enum types and their values
- Indexes and performance considerations

**Use this when**: You need to understand the database schema or add new tables/columns.

### [RLS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./RLS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)

Row-Level Security (RLS) implementation patterns:

- RLS context helpers (`withUserContext`, `withAdminContext`, `withSystemContext`)
- Security patterns and best practices
- Common RLS policy patterns
- Testing RLS policies

**Use this when**: Implementing new features that require database access with proper security.

### [RLS_POLICY_CATALOG.md](./RLS_POLICY_CATALOG.md)

Comprehensive catalog of all RLS policies:

- Policy definitions by table
- Access control rules
- Policy testing procedures
- Security audit checklist

**Use this when**: You need to understand existing RLS policies or create new ones.

### [RLS_DATABASE_MIGRATION_SOP.md](./RLS_DATABASE_MIGRATION_SOP.md)

Standard Operating Procedure for database migrations:

- Migration workflow (dev → staging → production)
- Schema change procedures
- RLS policy updates
- Rollback procedures
- Validation checklist

**Use this when**: You need to create or apply database migrations.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Always use RLS context helpers** - Never make direct Prisma calls
2. **Test RLS policies** - Verify isolation between users
3. **Follow migration SOP** - Schema changes require ARCHitect approval
4. **Update DATA_DICTIONARY.md** - Keep schema documentation current
